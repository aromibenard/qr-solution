## My process
- I created a grid with three columns and one row
- I then placed the main container in the second column to keep it centered on the page
- The image was nested in the main container, in a seperate container üòÅ
- text paragraphs was placed in another div, also inside the main container.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Css for styling

### What I learned

- Centering a div using Css grid

```html
<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="main-container"></div>
</div>
```
```css
.grid-container{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-gap: 5px;
    margin-top: 10%;
    margin-left: 5%;
    margin-right: 5%;
    margin-bottom: 10%;
    place-items: center;
}
.main-container{
    border-radius: 15px 15px 15px 15px;
    border: 1px solid hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    display: inline-block;
    width: 250px;
    grid-column-start: 2; 
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);   
}
```

### Continued development
